# Python & AI Portfolio

This repository contains a curated selection of my AI and Python projects.

I built these projects while learning machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and API-based automation.

## Projects Included
- Face detection using OpenCV
- Sentiment analysis / IMDB classifier
- Edge detection to blur 
- Gesture control using CV
- Creative coding (e.g., tic-tac-toe)

## Why this repo exists
To track my growth as a self-taught Python/AI learner  
and to present polished, well-documented projects.

## Future plans
- More ML models
- Kaggle experiments
- A larger AI-based tool

Python &amp; AI Portfolio:

This repository showcases selected projects I built while learning Python, AI, and machine learning.  
These projects reflect my interest in understanding how AI systems work, experimenting with real tools, and building practical applications.  
I focus on learning by building and improving through iteration.
